<h1>The Best Movies (According to Matthew)</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Favourite Movies</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</h3>
<p>This was the actually the first Indiana Jones movie I saw as a kid (I watched them out of order) but holds out as my favourite. 
   By the time the third Indiana Jones hit the screen, Spielberg and Lucas knew what worked. It also ties the franchise up neatly 
   (I don't recognize and Indiana Jones after this).
</p>
<h3>JoJo Rabbit</h3>
<p>Kind of weird that I have two movies with Nazis in a row, but JoJo Rabbit was brilliant and beautiful. I had never heard of it 
    prior to watching so it was a fun suprise.
</p>
<h3>The Lego Movies</h3>
<p>I'm a big animation fan and Lego was a staple of my childhood. When I first watched the Lego movie in theatres I was floored with
    the amount of care and detail they put into it.
